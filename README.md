# BetterDash

It is quite common for souls-like games to have some kind of iframes during dashes/rolls/dodges. Well not in Hollow Knight: Silksong! This mod rectifies that by adding a configurable amount of iframes after dashing. Can be used to dash trough enemies. Configuration is available in BepInEx under `BetterDash` entry.
